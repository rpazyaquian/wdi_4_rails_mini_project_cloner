# Hacker News

Hacker News is a website where links to news articles and blog posts are, well, posted. Each post consists of a link to an article (URL) with source, a title, and a link to a discussion. Alternatively, the URL field can be left blank to submit a "question" for discussion.

* User clicks submit post.
* A Post form appears.
* The User inputs a title and a URL.
* The User hits submit.
* The Post is added to the news feed.
* The Post shows up at the top.
* The User can subsequently Comment on the post.

A **User** can submit a **Post** and leave a **Comment** on the **Post**.
